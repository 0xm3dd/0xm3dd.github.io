## About this site

This website is a personal **cybersecurity knowledge base**.

It is used to document:
- Writeups (CTFs, labs, challenges)
- Cybersecurity concepts explained clearly
- Practical notes and methodologies
- Linux, networking, and system internals
- Tools, commands, and real-world techniques

The main goal is **learning by writing** and sharing structured, reproducible knowledge — not self-promotion.

Everything published here is written with clarity, practicality, and long-term reference in mind.
